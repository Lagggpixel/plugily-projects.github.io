### Bow trails

:::note
[List with particles](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Particles)
:::

#### Which particles/trails are inside the plugin?
You can use all particles that are on your minecraft version as we are importing the particles of the server version that is running

#### How it works?
For all `trails` a player has permissions to, a `trail` is **randomly** picked and displayed.
If the player has no access to any trail, it _will not display any trail_.

#### What are the permissions for trails?
`murdermystery.trails.<lowercased_particle_name>`
:::tip
Example you want to give the heart particle to your players.

Particle name: **HEART** -> lowercased: **heart** -> Permission: **`murdermystery.trails.heart`**
:::

### Corpses last words and their permissions

:::important
Since version 1.7.5 you can add as many last words + permissions as you want.
:::

#### How to add new ones?
```yml
Last-Words:
'default':
Message: "&fPlease respawn :("
'meme':
Message: "&fDespacito 2 is confirmed by God"
Permission: "murdermystery.lastwords.meme"
'rage':
Message: "&fWHY YOU KILLED ME?!!?"
Permission: "murdermystery.lastwords.rage"
'pro':
Message: "&fIt was lagging..."
Permission: "murdermystery.lastwords.pro"
'hacker':
Message: "Turn off your hacks..."
Permission: "murdermystery.lastwords.hacker"
// highlight-start
###HOW TO ADD A NEW ONE
'newLastWord':
Message: "Awesome new last word"
Permission: "murdermystery.lastwords.nicenewpermission"
// highlight-end
```
#### How it works?
For all `last words` a player has permissions to, a `last word` is **randomly** picked and displayed.
If the player has no access to any last word, either the last word with **no permission** (priority) or the **first one in the list** will be picked out (fallback)

## Kit permissions

Every kit has its own permission node to access it. Even if it's level kit, you can still unlock it getting its
permission.

**Example:**

<Tabs groupId="minigame" defaultValue="villagedefense" queryString
      values={[
          {label: 'VillageDefense', value: 'villagedefense',},
          {label: 'BuildBattle', value: 'buildbattle',},
          {label: 'MurderMystery', value: 'murdermystery',},
          {label: 'TheBridge', value: 'thebridge',},
      ]}>
<TabItem value="villagedefense">

* Archer kit permission - **`villagedefense.kit.archer`**
* Tornado kit permission - **`villagedefense.kit.tornado`**

:::note
**Info!** **Locked kits** also unlocks with `"villagedefense.kits.locked"` permissions and **leveled kits** are unlocked too when
certain level is reached.

## Custom permissions

Custom permissions are used for giving your players more boosts in game.

:::danger
Using dots `.` in custom permissions **will not work and will break permission**, don't use them!
:::

Custom permissions can be found in **[permissions.yml](/minigame/support/files#permissionsyml)**:

### Example for EXP Boost
```yml
Exp-Boost:
  # Increase exp by 10 percent
  exp-boost-10: 10
  exp-boost-50: 50
  # Increase exp by 300 percent
  admin-boost: 300
```

<Tabs groupId="minigame" defaultValue="villagedefense" queryString
      values={[
          {label: 'VillageDefense', value: 'villagedefense',},
          {label: 'BuildBattle', value: 'buildbattle',},
          {label: 'MurderMystery', value: 'murdermystery',},
          {label: 'TheBridge', value: 'thebridge',},
      ]}>
<TabItem value="villagedefense">

**You will need to add the permission `villagedefense.exp-boost-10` for the player to get 10 percent increase!**
:::note
**Permissions can be combined!** Giving player permission **`villagedefense.exp-boost-10`** and **`villagedefense.exp-boost-50`** will receive **60%** more orbs on the pickup!
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="buildbattle">

**You will need to add the permission `buildbattle.exp-boost-10` for the player to get 10 percent increase!**
:::note
**Permissions can be combined!** Giving player permission **`buildbattle.exp-boost-10`** and **`buildbattle.exp-boost-50`** will receive **60%** more orbs on the pickup!
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="murdermystery">

**You will need to add the permission `murdermystery.exp-boost-10` for the player to get 10 percent increase!**
:::note
**Permissions can be combined!** Giving player permission **`murdermystery.exp-boost-10`** and **`murdermystery.exp-boost-50`** will receive **60%** more orbs on the pickup!
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="thebridge">

**You will need to add the permission `thebridge.exp-boost-10` for the player to get 10 percent increase!**
:::note
**Permissions can be combined!** Giving player permission **`thebridge.exp-boost-10`** and **`thebridge.exp-boost-50`** will receive **60%** more orbs on the pickup!
:::

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::caution Be aware of low percent values
Remember that 10% more exp are actually nothing because it's e.g. 10 exp + **(1) only 10% of this value more** so you won't see any significant increase, use higher values too see the difference if you don't trust this ;)
