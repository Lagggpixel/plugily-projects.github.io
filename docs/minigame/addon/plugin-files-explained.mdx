    #
    #  Commands examples:
    #    - p:say New achievement, yeah!                 # Player will say "New achievement, yeah!"
    #    - bc %player% unlocked achievement Killer!     # Will broadcast "<player name> unlocked achievement Killer" message
    #    - chance(1):p:say I was very lucky!            # Player has 1% chance to say "I was very lucky!"
    #    - p:chance(99):spawn                           # Player has 99% chance to teleport to spawn
