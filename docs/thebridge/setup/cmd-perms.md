## Basic permissions

Basic permissions are default permissions for games. Default permissions can be found in **`config.yml`.** You can edit them to your likings.

```text
Basic-Permissions:
  Full-Games-Permission: "thebridge.fullgames"
  # <arena> represents arena name (NOT MAP NAME!), for example: 'thebridge.join.AC02'
  # use 'thebridge.join.*' to enable access to all arenas
  Join-Permission: "thebridge.join.<arena>"
  Kits-Permission: "thebridge.kits"
```

> **Full-Games-Permission** - Permission to join full arenas
>
> **Join-Permission** - Permission to join arenas
>
> Ki**ts-Permission** - Permission to get all kits

## Kits permissions

Every kit has its own permission node to access it. Even if it's level kit, you can still unlock it getting its permission.

**Example:**

* Archer kit permission - **`thebridge.kit.archer`**
* Heavy Tank kit permission - **`thebridge.kit.heavytank`**

:::note
**Info!** **Premium kits** also unlocks with full kit permissions \( `thebridge.kits` \) and **leveled kits** are unlocked too when certain level is reached.
