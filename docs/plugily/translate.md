## What are fuzzy translations / Translations are wrong but it tells 100 percent done / placeholders are wrong on the translation
It can happen that placeholders/messages in the plugin have changed, which means that the translations are no longer up to date. PoEditor marks changed translations as "fuzzy". Such marked translations should be revised and then the status "fuzzy" removed independently by the modifier. So if you found a issue like that we recommend to join the translation project and change it by your own and reach us to us to update it as stated at [When will the languages be updated](#when-will-the-languages-be-updated)
## When will languages be added
Languages will be accepted from a translation percentage of at least 60%.
## When will the languages be updated
Since our new generation of plugins (minigames-core) updates to the language can be made seamlessly. We update it on every new release or when you make a request. The updates do not require a plugin update, they are processed by our server.
