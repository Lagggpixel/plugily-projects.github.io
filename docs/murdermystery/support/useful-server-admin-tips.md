### Using Bungee?

**1.** Install the party plugin on your bungee and spigot server and restart both servers

**2.** Make sure to use the same database on both servers. (If you use MySQL us the same database and set it up on both servers)

**(3.)** Only if you use PAF for Bungee, you will need to install the [PAF Addon](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/39751/) and follow the instruction of it.

Basically the party plugin on spigot works as a brige beetween bungee - (spigot) - our minigame
