## Basic permissions

Basic permissions are default permissions for games. Default permissions can be found in **`config.yml`.** You can edit them to your likings.

```text
Basic-Permissions:
  Full-Games-Permission: "villagedefense.fullgames"
  Vip-Permission: "villagedefense.vip"
  Mvp-Permission: "villagedefense.mvp"
  Elite-Permission: "villagedefense.elite"
  Arena-Edit-Permission: "villagedefense.edit"
  Join-Permission: "villagedefense.join.<arena>"
```

> **Full-Games-Permission** - Permission to join full arenas
>
> **Vip-Permission** - Gives permission to **donator kits**, joining **full games** and getting **50% more orbs**
>
> **Mvp-Permission** - Same as `Vip-Permission` but gives **100% more orbs**
>
> **Elite-Permission** - Same as `Vip-Permission` but gives **150% more orbs**
>
> **Arena-Edit-Permission** - Permission for creating arenas, overrides disabled commands option via config.yml
>
> **Join-Permission** - Permission to join arenas

## Custom permissions

Custom permissions are used for giving your players more orbs in game. Nothing more, nothing less.

:::caution
Using dots `.` in custom permissions will not work and will break permission, don't use them!
:::

Custom permissions can be set up in **config.yml**:

```text
CustomPermissions:
  player-booster: 10
  vip-booster: 100
  staff-booster: 1000
```

> **player-booster** - Gives player with this permission 10% more orbs on pickup
>
> **vip-booster** - Gives player 100% more orbs
>
> **staff-booster** - 1000% more orbs

:::caution
**Avoid low percent values!** Remember that 10% more orbs are actually nothing because it's 5~8 orbs + **only 10% of this value more** so you won't see any significant increase, use higher values too see the difference
:::

:::note
**Permissions can be combined!** Giving player permission **`player.booster`** and **`vip.booster`** will receive 110% more orbs on the pickup!
:::

## Kits permissions

Every kit has its own permission node to access it. Even if it's level kit, you can still unlock it getting its permission.

**Example:**

* Archer kit permission - **`villagedefense.kit.archer`**
* Tornado kit permission - **`villagedefense.kit.tornado`**
* Heavy Tank kit permission - **`villagedefense.kit.heavytank`**

:::note
**Info!** **Premium kits** also unlocks with Vip/Mvp or Elite permissions and **leveled kits** are unlocked too when certain level is reached.
