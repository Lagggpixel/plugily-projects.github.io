## Basic permissions

Basic premissions are default permissions for games. Default permissions can be found in **`config.yml`.** You can edit them to your likings.

```text

  Full-Games-Permission: "murdermystery.fullgames"
  # <arena> represents arena name (NOT MAP NAME!), for example: 'murdermystery.join.MM02'
  # use 'murdermystery.join.*' to enable access to all arenas
  Join-Permission: "murdermystery.join.<arena>"
```
