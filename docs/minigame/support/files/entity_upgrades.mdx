## Work with the file

:::note

Upvote [Feedbacky Idea](https://app.feedbacky.net/i/modifiable-entity-upgrades.4865) to let the upgrades make more modifiable!

:::

You can't add new upgrade types or tiers, they are not modifiable!

```yml
Entity-Upgrades:
  # Cost of x tier (in orbs), ex 1: 100 means 1st tier cost 100 orbs to upgrade
  Health-Tiers:
    '1': 100
    '2': 200
    '3': 350
    '4': 500
```

:::tip example

Tier 4 of health cost 500 orbs ingame! It will give a predefined value of health extra to the entity.
