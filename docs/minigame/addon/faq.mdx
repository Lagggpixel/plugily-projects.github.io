## How does replay ability work?

After the game ends players receive message

 "Game has ended! Want to play again? Click here"

 like in the biggest network and when you click it you'll be teleported to the new arena!

**If you have one arena per server \(bungee cord\) it will teleport it to the different server too! Just configure it in** _**replay\_notifier.yml**_ **file**

## How can I translate messages?

Sadly, you can't. This addon is meant to be used once for create custom kits and then have fun with extended game of our plugins. Messages aren't configurable too because they are mostly on the admin side, however, **all custom kits messages you create are fully configurable.**
