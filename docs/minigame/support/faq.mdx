Some basic questions and answers

### Supported server versions of our plugins {#version-support}

Supported server versions are currently 1.8.8 - 1.20
If your plugin doesn't startup and you don't have this version you're receiving a message like:

```text
  _   _           _                                                    _                _
 | \ | |   ___   | |_     ___   _   _   _ __    _ __     ___    _ __  | |_    ___    __| |

Your server version is not supported by us!
Sadly, we must shut off. Maybe you consider changing your server version?

### What do our plugins modify in the worlds being used?

<Tabs groupId="minigame" defaultValue="villagedefense" queryString
  values={[
      {label: 'VillageDefense', value: 'villagedefense',},
      {label: 'BuildBattle', value: 'buildbattle',},
      {label: 'MurderMystery', value: 'murdermystery',},
      {label: 'TheBridge', value: 'thebridge',},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="villagedefense">

* Blocks creatures other than Village Defense ones
* Blocks mob spawning in a range of 150 in all directions from arena start location
* Does not block custom or command spawned creatures
* Cleans hoppers inventories
* Manipulates Villager entities
* **Might not be compatible with other minigames \(zombies/villagers will be invisible\)**

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="buildbattle">

* **Might not be compatible with other minigames \(game behavior may broke\)**

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="murdermystery">

* Visibility of players in the world
* Modifies armorstands that are used for the arena
* **Might not be compatible with other minigames \(game behavior may broke\)**

## Players can't join through signs

This is a very common problem in every minigame plugin.

It's **caused by spawn protection** feature in vanilla Minecraft.

To disable this go to **server.properties** and change **spawn-protection** value **to 0**.

## How does randomjoin work?

### There are kinda like two cases:

All arenas on `waiting for players` stage: It will send players to a random arena

One (or more) arenas are on `starting` stage: It will send players to one random arena that is on starting stage

## How does maxplayers join work?

You will be redirect to the arena with most players on it which isn't started yet.

## How can I enable my old Scoreboard after leaving the game?

:::important
You have to enable rewards in your config.yml ( `Rewards-Enabled: true` )
:::

Please edit the following section in your rewards.yml file:

    #Helpful for servers that are using more than one scoreboard!
    scoreboard_remove:
    - commands to execute

With the type `scoreboard_remove` you execute commands after removing our scoreboard.

There you can add for example the following command:
* `- p:sb on` to execute the command /sb on from the player
* or `- sb on %PLAYER%` to execute the command /sb on %PLAYER% from the console

Be sure to use commands that your plugin supports!

[Learn more about the Rewards.yml here](files)

:::note
If your scoreboard plugin doesn't support a command to activate the scoreboard please contact the dev of the plugin to add this command!
